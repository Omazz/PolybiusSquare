# PolybiusSquare
The Polybius Square cipher allows us to encrypt text using the word.
The text is encrypted using a 5x5 square if we use the English alphabet (i = j). If we use a key, then it goes to the first cells, and the rest are filled with letters in accordance with the alphabet, but only those that have not yet existed.
You can enter the key yourself, or you can generate it in the program.
In addition to encryption and decryption functions, frequency analysis is also implemented.
